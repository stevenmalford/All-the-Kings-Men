The demo version gives the player access to the initial starting room (The Great Hall) of All the King's Men with all enemy types that are currently in the game. The player can progress through this room to the Archives - the first boss room.

In the demo, pressing G gives the player 100,000 gold for testing purposes. This gold can be used to level up stats in order to test mechanics with higher stats. There is no limit to the amount of gold that can be gained through this method.
